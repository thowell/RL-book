\paragraph{1.}
The state space of Snakes and Ladders has 100 discrete states $\mathcal{S} = [1, 100]$. There is a single terminal state $\mathcal{T} = 100$. States $s_t \in [1, 95]$ have six possible next states $s_t$, each with equal probability of transition, $\mathcal{P}(S_{t+1} | S_t) = \frac{1}{6}$. Often, $s_{t+1}$ is simply the current state plus whatever number is rolled. However, in the cases where a snake or ladder exists the mapping is different. States $s_t \in [95, 100]$ have less possible next states (fewer for states that are near 100) with more probability of transitioning into the next state.

\paragraph{2.}
Fig. \ref{snakes_and_ladders} shows a histogram with the number of transitions required to complete Snakes and Ladders over 100 trials. See $\texttt{snakes\_and\_ladders.py}$.
